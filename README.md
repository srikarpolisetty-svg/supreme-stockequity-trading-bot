# AI-Based Market Data Processing System

This repository contains an actively developed Python-based system for collecting, cleaning, and statistically labeling high-frequency market data.

The project uses custom DuckDB databases and statistical methods (such as z-scores from AP Statistics) to normalize price, volume, and volatility data and evaluate signal strength and consistency over time.

This is a data engineering and analysis project, not a production trading system.
